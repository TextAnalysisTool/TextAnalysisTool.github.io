If you're not already viewing this document with TextAnalysisTool.NET, please 
do so by running the application and choosing the Help | Documentation menu 
item.  Having done so, you should be seeing this documentation file displayed 
in the top part of the application's window along with a few handy filters in 
the bottom part of the window.  To quickly see what section headings this 
document has, click the "Section:" filter to enable it - and while you're at it 
go ahead and enable the next filter down, too: "Marked by marker 1".  Notice 
how all lines that don't match the filters you just enabled have been dimmed.  
Click anywhere in the line display to give it focus and then hit the Space bar 
a few times to cycle forward through all the matching lines (use Shift+Space to 
cycle backward).  To take things a step further, hit Ctrl+H or choose the View 
| Show Only Filtered Lines menu option.  Because you're now seeing only the 
lines you're interested in, it's easy to avoid getting bogged down by spurious 
details.  Use the arrow keys to highlight the section on command-line 
parameters (it's near the bottom) and hit Ctrl+H again to view the selected 
line in the context of its surroundings.  Explore the power of this interface 
by enabling and disabling some of the other sample filters, then read the rest 
of this document to find out how to take advantage of more neat features!

-- Section: Overview --
-----------------------

The Problem: For those times when you have to analyze a large amount of textual 
data, picking out the relevant line(s) of interest can be quite difficult.  
Standard text editors usually provide a generic "find" function, but the 
limitations of that simple approach quickly become apparent (e.g., when it is 
necessary to compare two or more widely separated lines).  Some more 
sophisticated editors do better by allowing you to "bookmark" lines of 
interest; this can be a big help, but is often not enough.

The Solution: TextAnalysisTool.NET - a program designed from the start to excel 
at viewing, searching, and navigating large files quickly and efficiently.  
TextAnalysisTool.NET provides a view of the file that you can easily manipulate 
(through the use of various filters) to display exactly the information you 
need - as you need it.

Filters: Before displaying the lines of a file, TextAnalysisTool.NET passes the 
lines of that file through a set of user-defined filters, dimming or hiding all 
lines that do not satisfy any of the filters.  Filters can select only the 
lines that contain a sub-string, those that have been marked with a particular 
marker type, or those that match a regular expression.  Text and background 
colors can be associated with each filter so that lines matching a particular 
filter stand out and lines matching different filters can be easily distinguished. 
In addition to the normal "including" filters that isolate lines of text you DO 
want to see, there are also "excluding" filters that can be used to suppress 
lines you do NOT want to see.  Excluding filters are configured just like including 
filters but are processed afterward and remove all matching lines from the set.  
Excluding filters allow you to easily refine your search even further.

Markers: Markers are another way that TextAnalysisTool.NET makes it easy to 
navigate a file; you can mark any line with one or more of eight different 
marker types.  Once lines have been marked, you can quickly navigate between 
similarly marked lines - or add a "marked by" filter to view only those lines.

Find: TextAnalysisTool.NET also provides a flexible "find" function that allows 
you to search for text anywhere within a file.  This text can be a literal 
string or a regular expression, so it's easy to find a specific line.  If you 
decide to turn a find string into a filter, the history feature of both dialogs 
makes it easy.

Summary: TextAnalysisTool.NET was written with speed and ease of use in mind 
throughout.  It saves you time by allowing you to save and load filter sets; it 
lets you import text by opening a file, dragging-and-dropping a file or text 
from another application, or by pasting text from the clipboard; and it allows 
you to share the results of your filters by copying lines to the clipboard or 
by saving the current lines to a file.  TextAnalysisTool.NET supports files 
encoded with ANSI, UTF-8, Unicode, and big-endian Unicode and is designed to 
handle large files efficiently.

---------------------------------

Display
-------

Line Display: The line display shows all of the lines with which you are 
currently working.  Each line is shown with its original line number, an 
indication of which markers have been applied to it, and colored according to 
whether or not it matches any of the current filters (if a line matches more 
than one filter it will be colored by the topmost colored filter in the filter 
display).  Any selected lines are highlighted; actions like toggling markers or 
copying to the clipboard affect all selected lines.  Non-contiguous selections 
can be made in the usual manner with the Shift and Ctrl keys.

Filter Display: The filter display shows the filters with which you are 
currently working.  Filters can be enabled or disabled by clicking on the 
checkboxes next to them, they can be edited by double-clicking or pressing 
Enter, and they can be re-arranged through drag and drop. Further functionality 
is available from the Filters menu or from the context menu obtained by right-
clicking on any filter.  Lines matching any of the first twenty-six filters can 
be easily cycled through with the keyboard.

Status Bar: The status bar at the bottom of the window contains information
about the currently loaded file and some indicators about the current state of
TextAnalysisTool.NET.

-- Section: Plug-ins --
-----------------------

TextAnalysisTool.NET's support for plug-ins allows users to add in their own 
code that understands specialized file types.  Every time a file is opened, 
each plug-in is given a chance to take responsibility for parsing that file.  
When a plug-in takes responsibility for parsing a file, it becomes that plug-
in's job to produce a textual representation of the file for display in the 
usual line display.  If no plug-in supports a particular file, then it gets 
opened using TextAnalysisTool.NET's default parser (which displays the file's 
contents directly).  One example of what a plug-in could do is read a binary 
file format and produce meaningful textual output from it (e.g., if the file is 
compressed or encrypted).  Another plug-in might add support for the .zip 
format and display a list of the files within the archive.  A particularly 
ambitious plug-in might translate text files from one language to another.  The 
possibilities are endless!

Plug-ins are "installed" simply by copying the relevant implementation file 
("TATPlugin_*.dll") to the same folder as the TextAnalysisTool.NET program file 
(TextAnalysisTool.NET.exe).  Every time TextAnalysisTool.NET starts up, it 
searches its startup folder for plug-in files and attempts to load each of 
them.  From then on, installed plug-ins are seamlessly integrated with the rest 
of the application.  To see a list of active plug-ins, use the Help | Installed 
plug-ins menu item.


------------------------------------------------
-- Section: Differences from TextAnalysisTool --
------------------------------------------------

TextAnalysisTool.NET represents a complete rewrite of TextAnalysisTool to 
produce a fully managed-code application built on top of the .NET Framework.  
Efforts were made during development of the user interface to maintain the 
default/recommended behavior in all cases - except where it was possible to 
make significant usability or performance gains by doing things differently.  
Consequently, though TextAnalysisTool.NET's features are a strict superset of 
TextAnalysisTool's; some of those features may be exposed in a slightly 
different manner.  Apologies for the inconvenience to loyal users!


----------------------------------------
-- Section: Regular Expression Syntax --
----------------------------------------

TextAnalysisTool.NET uses the standard .NET Framework regular expression class 
Regex, and therefore supports the same regular expression syntax as is exposed 
by the .NET Framework.  For more details, please refer to the ".NET Framework 
Regular Expressions" page in MSDN: <http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-
us/cpguide/html/cpconcomregularexpressions.asp>.  (Note that you can right-
click the "Regular expression" checkbox from the relevant TextAnalysisTool.NET 
dialog boxes to automatically open this web page in your default browser.)


--------------------------------------
-- Section: Command-Line Parameters --
--------------------------------------

TextAnalysisTool.NET.exe [InputFile] [/Filters:FilterFile] [/Config:ConfigFile]
   InputFile - Name of the file to open and display 
   FilterFile - Name of a .tat file containing a saved filter configuration
   ConfigFile - Name of an .xml file containing configuration options

Examples:
TextAnalysisTool.NET.exe \Logs\MyLog.log /Filters:"\Saved Filters\MyFilters.tat"

TextAnalysisTool.NET.exe \Logs\MyLog.log /Config:"\configs\MyConfig.xml"

Note that several /Filters flags can be supplied on the command line.
TextAnalysisTool.NET will append the filters from all supplied filter files.

Configuration options loaded from the command line become active when
TextAnalysisTool.NET starts and are saved to the registry when it is closed.


---------------------------------
-- Section: Configuration File --
---------------------------------

You can customize certain aspects of the user interface through a configuration
file that can be imported from the Preferences dialog ("Preferences..." in the
Edit menu) with the "Import..." button.
An initial version of the file can be generated by using the "Export..." button
from the same "Preferences..." dialog. This will generate the configuration XML
file with all the available options. Once generated, you can remove some of the
configuration options from the file if you don't want to override the current
application value for that option.


--------------------------
-- Section: Bug Reports --
--------------------------

Please create an issue at https://github.com/TextAnalysisTool/Releases/issues
with a detailed description of any problem you encounter.  Whenever possible,
please include a file demonstrating the problem.


Thanks and enjoy!!!
