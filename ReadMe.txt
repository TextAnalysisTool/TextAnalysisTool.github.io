-- Requirements --
------------------

Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 (or later versions)

Note: TextAnalysisTool.NET is compiled for .NET 4.0. Later .NET Framework
versions are supported through a .config that needs to be configured for
the corresponding version. For more information, please refer to the
following MSDN article: "How to: Configure an App to Support .NET Framework 4
or 4.5"
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj152935.aspx


-------------------------------
-- Installation Instructions --
-------------------------------
1) Copy TextAnalysisTool.NET.exe and TextAnalysisTool.NET.exe.config to a
   local folder
2) Run TextAnalysisTool.NET.exe

-- Known Issues --
------------------
* GDI+ occasionally throws a System.Runtime.InteropServices.ExternalException
  with the message "A generic error occurred in GDI+.". This exceptional
  condition causes TextAnalysisTool.NET to exit after notifying the user.
  One cause of this was rendering very long lines. To avoid this the app now
  takes a safe substring of the original line based on the width of the rendered
  characters. The message "[TextAnalysisTool.NET could not display the whole line.
  Filtering, copying, and searching are unaffected.]" is included at the end of the
  line to indicate truncation. Filtering, searching, and copying are all still
  performed on the complete text of the line.
* The .NET Framework's improper handling of vertical and horizontal scrollbar
  messages for ListBoxes can cause rendering problems for files with very many
  or very long lines.
* Checkboxes don't always repaint properly due to a .NET Framework bug.
* There is extra flicker when resizing the window. This is due to a workaround
  for an even worse .NET Framework repainting bug.
* ListBox limitations on 16-bit OSes (Windows 95/98/Me) prevent files with
  more than 32,767 lines from displaying properly.
* The font size selected in the preferences dialog will sometimes be overridden
  by a slightly larger or smaller size. This is the expected behavior as .Net
  and GDI work together to pick a size that will render properly. See also

-- Notes --
-----------
One of TextAnalysisTool.NET's core principles is that data should be read one
time as soon as it is available and kept in memory after that. This principle
allows the source data to be amended, changed, or even become unavailable
without affecting the user. Though this principle is an optional convenience
when the data source is a file, it is a strict requirement for data sources
that offer only one chance to read their data (such as the clipboard and plug-
ins). Accordingly, TextAnalysisTool.NET keeps the entire data set in memory at
all times which means that particularly large data sets can tax systems with
comparatively few available resources. The prototypical example is loading a
file that is larger than the amount of memory in the system: performance
suffers. TextAnalysisTool.NET strives to be as responsive as possible under
all circumstances, but is ultimately bound by the resources available to it.

-- History --
-------------

2018-11-20 by Vince Curley and Jenny Leung
----------
* Add new function in ITextAnalysisToolPlugin to support configurable plug-ins
  via popup dialog.
* Add new item to Edit menu to list configurable plug-ins.
* Support custom foreground and background colors for filters.

2018-01-03 by David Anson
----------
* Fixed an intermittent bug preventing the window from showing on the taskbar.

2017-12-18 by David Anson
----------
* Added a separate build without plugin support for environments that forbid
  DLL loading.

2017-12-14 by Vince Curley
----------
* Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when changing files with active filters.
* Added the "Show Filter Tool Tip" setting to control whether or not to display
  a tool tip with the matching filters for each line.

2017-01-24 by Vince Curley
----------
* Fixed a bug that would prevent settings from being saved when FontFamily or
  ZoomPercent had default values but no key in the registry.

2016-12-09 by Vince Curley
----------
* Added the "Mark Filters Changed" setting to control when the filter list is
  considered changed. This gives the flexibility to enable, disable, or move
  filters without "dirtying" the list and causing a prompt to save on exit.

2016-10-29 by Vince Curley
----------
* Added font name and size to the preferences dialog. The displayed font size
  is controlled by the base font size and the zoom level.
* Added /Line command line argument to jump to that line when a file is opened
* Fix a bug where the '&' character in lines was displayed incorrectly
* Updated menu and command line options in documentation

2016-06-16 by David Anson
----------
* Updated the link to the .NET Framework Regular Expressions documentation

2016-04-22 by Vince Curley
----------
* Added ability to dock the filter list to any side of the main window
* Added a tool tip to show what filters each line matches
* Prompt to save the filter list before overwriting it when filters are
  loaded from a file and before exiting the app. Prompting only happens if
  there is a backing filter file (that is, if filters were loaded from a
  file or saved to a file) so we don't prompt to save ad-hoc, temporary filters.
* Include the filter file name (if any) and a "filters changed" indicator
  in the main window title bar.
* Fixed a bug that would cause a crash when displaying lines with several
  thousand characters. Such lines will now be truncated when displayed,
  with a message indicating so. Filtering, searching, and copying
  will still work on the complete text of the line.

2016-01-08 by Vince Curley
----------
* Added a setting to control whether or not line numbers are displayed
* Added a setting to control whether or not line numbers are included when
  copying text to the clipboard
* Added a setting to control whether or not a warning is displayed when
  replacing text being analyzed with content from the clipboard or
  drag-and-drop.
* Fixed a bug that prevented consistent zooming with the mouse scroll wheel
* Fixed a bug where the hit count didn't update when a new file was opened
